# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website where users can analyze data of UFO sitings by filtering the data using a variety of parameters (date, city, state, country, and/or UFO shape). 

## Results
When users initially visit the site, they will see a table of all the UFO sitings data and to the left of the table, they will see several filter fields (See figure 1). Each filter field shows an example of how the desired query must be entered into the field. 
*A note of caution.* Users must enter information in the fields *EXACTLY* as the data appears in the table column.

As users enter information into each field and then press "enter" or click outside the field, the table will atuomatically update to show data specific to the parameters entered (See figures 2 and 3). Users can filter the table using one filter parameter or all filter parameters.

## Summary
While this page offers well organized information about UFO sitings in a table, there is some work that could be done to make it more user friendly. Currently, data must be entered exactly as it appears in the table; however, a user may make an error in spelling, might mistype something, or use capitalization. Changing the script, to find data with a similar spelling or disregarding capitalization would make the filters more accessible to users.

Additional recommendations are 
- to include an interactive map that updates as filter fields are updated and drops a pin to show each UFO siting. Users could hover over the pins and the table with the UFO siting could appear upon hovering or clicking the pin.
- to include an option of a graphical display where users could compare sitings across cities, states, countries, or dates. Users could determine what variables they are interested in comparing and click a button to upload a graphical display.
