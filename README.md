# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website where users could analyze data of UFO sitings through various filters (date, city, state, country, and/or UFO shape). 

## Results
When users initially visit the site, they will see a table of all the UFO sitings data and to the left several filter fields (See figure 1).

As users enter information into the fileds, the fields will update (See figures 2 and 3). 
- A note of caution! Users must enter information in the fields *EXACTLY* as it appears in the table.
