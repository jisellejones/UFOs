# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website where users can analyze data of UFO sitings by filtering the data using a variety of parameters (date, city, state, country, and/or UFO shape). 

## Results
When users initially visit the site, they will see a table of all the UFO sitings data and to the left of the table, they will see several filter fields (See figure 1). Each filter field shows an example of how the desired query must be entered into the field. 
*A note of caution.* Users must enter information in the fields *EXACTLY* as the data appears in the table column.

As users enter information into the fileds and either click "enter" or click outside the field, the table will update (See figures 2 and 3). 
Again, a users must enter information in the fields *EXACTLY* as it appears in the table. Users can filter the table using one filter parameter or all filter parameters.
